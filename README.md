# Greenhouse Gas Emission Monitoring System

## Overview
The **Greenhouse Gas Emission Monitoring System** is a web-based platform designed to track, compare, and visualize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across different regions and countries. The system allows users to compare emissions, view historical trends, and explore news related to emission data. This platform is built with a focus on front-end design and user interaction.

## Features

- **Compare Emissions in Two Regions**: Allows users to compare emission data from two different regions.
- **Country Graph**: Visualizes emission data for a specific country.
- **Latest News Based on Region**: Displays the latest news related to emissions and environmental impacts in specific regions.
- **Historical Trends of Gases**: Provides a graphical representation of historical emission data.
- **AI Prediction of Emission**: Simulates AI predictions for emission trends based on historical data (for future implementation).
- **Regional Gas Data**: Shows region-specific emission data for various greenhouse gases.
- **Emission Reports**: Allows users to explore detailed reports on emissions (currently a static feature).
- **User Profiles**: Users can view their profiles and emission data.
- **Edit Profile**: Users can update their profile information.
- **Logout Option**: A simple logout button to clear the session.
